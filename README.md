# Overview
This is an end-to-end Data Analysis Project I did in Winter 2025. This project analyzes banking transaction data using **MySQL** to uncover transaction trends, customer behavior, and potential fraud signals. The analysis is designed to be a suitable for report and extensible to Power BI and Python (Later Update).

# Dataset
- A Kaggle Dataset: **Bank Transaction Dataset for Fraud Detection**. Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/bank-transaction-dataset-for-fraud-detection
- Includes ~2500 banking transactions, including transaction details (such as AccountID, TransactionID, TransactionAmount,...), Customer Behavior (TransactionType (Credit, Debit), TransactionChannel(ATM, Online)), Device Usage (DeviceID, IPAddress) and Login Activity (Login Attempts)
- The dataset is synthetic and honest, designed specifically for analytics and fraud detection practice

# Techstack
1. First Deliverable: **SQL**
- MySQL version 8.0 as the main analytics tool
- Docker (to create local MySQL environment)
- DBeaver (for navigate database)
- GitHub (for documentation)
